Ellevens and Gareth Bale aimed to create an esports team for sports fans
Historically, traditional sports fans don't really mesh well with the esports community. However, with soccer superstar Gareth Bale acting as a bridge between those two cultures things started to look differently.

Gareth's agency reached out to AoE Creative and asked for assistance in creating an esports team brand from scratch.After running through the initial exercises of brand building, Ellevens looked to be a team focused on excellence, community, and creativity.

Keeping that in mind while going into the look and feel stage brought about the idea of painting and brush strokes. The idea is simple, yet is pure, honest, and personal.
