TITLE: Nerd Street Gamers - Brand
TYPE: portfolio
====================

Nerd Street Gamers wanted a rebrand to match how they had grown.
Nerd Street Gamers (NSG) had started as a passion project in Philadelphia and grown to the point where they are working with major endemic and non endemic companies to the gaming space.

They came to AoE Creative looking for a full rebrand that showed they were a professional company that had not lost touch with it's roots in gaming.We worked on first establishing the brand core values and pillars and from there established a voice and tone for the brand that felt professional yet conversational.

After we began establishing a look and feel for the brand that carried this theme of being "adaptable". The idea is that NSG works with it's children companies and others so often that their colors can be adopted into graphics of NSG.
