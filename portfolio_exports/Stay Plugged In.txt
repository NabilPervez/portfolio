Texas banded together around the Houston Outlaws
For the opening season of Overwatch League, I was tasked with local marketing for the Houston Outlaws.

My goal was to grow, connect, and engage a brand new audience of Overwatch fans spread out across Houston, Austin, and San Antonio.

The award winning #BandTogether campaign successfully brought together fans all across south Texas together for watch parties, block parties, pop up shops, player tours, and trade shows.We also enabled them to show their colors through a variety of limited, collectible, and region specific merchandise.

The goal being that fans would travel from all over Texas to attend events, meet their community, and trade effectively to have the full collection.
