TITLE: Immortal: Gates Of Pyre - Lorebook + Videos
TYPE: portfolio
====================

Printing The Universe
With the world of IMMORTAL: Gates Of Pyre expanding, the SunSpear Games team was looking for a way to consolidate all their lore into something bite sized.

We aimed to create a lore book that the average user to big league investor would find accessible.

Additionally, we aimed to create videos to pair along with the book to supplement the meetings with investors that were struggling to visualize the full picture of Immortal.Leading the project mean becoming the bridge between the Immortal creative team and the AOE design team.

Clearly communicating expectations, capabilities, and timing was key.

Working together we put together a beautiful lore book to be proud of that won Sunspear a lot of business.
