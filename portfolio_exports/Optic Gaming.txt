TITLE: Optic Gaming
TYPE: portfolio
====================

Optic Gaming was a legacy brand that needed fresh ideas.
When first working on the legendary Optic brand, the fan base was not being properly engaged.

The team had begun to turn things around on social media, but the look of Optic was dated. There were no values that were associated with the team.

I worked with the marketing team to establish the new mottoPower. Precision. Prestige.

Power - Since Optic and the fanbase were very alpha, elite, and dominate.

Precision - Optic's origins began as a COD sniper montage team.

Prestige - Every year new titles come out for COD and the team begins to learn to again to be the best in the league.The event side of Optic was non existent.

I worked together with the team to create a variety of events around the re-launch of the Optic brand and the championship Gears of War team.

These activations varied from special ops themed scavenger hunts to playing with the pros.
