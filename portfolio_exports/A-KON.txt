====================

Anime Unchained
A-KON had solidified itself as one of the largest anime conventions in all of America and the largest in Texas.

However, the brand was due for a refresh after remaining the same for two decades.Our approach was to better understand what a modern A-KON looks, thinks, and speaks like.

I lead the project and assisted with branding, marketing concepts, event concepts, and web design consulting.
