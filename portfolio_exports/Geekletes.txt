Building a look and a home for Geekletes
When we met Geekletes, we found individuals with a ton of passion that were deeply connected in the local NBA 2K community.

They had found themselves in a unique position with a new venue, but were in need of direction.I lead the project to provide Geekletes a look and feel and direction with it's local events efforts.

Additionally, this came with local marketing strategies and influencer marketing for the DFW metroplex.
