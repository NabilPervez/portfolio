From Nutmilk To Creamcheese
Paramount in combination with Funny Or Die aimed to put together a mockumentary of a League Of Legends team "Fugitive" climb to the NALCS and it's future with the star player Creamcheese.

However, with limited time approaching the team needed branding.

The team behind American Vandal were told to reach out by the LCS to solve their issue.After multiple calls to understand the plot, their vision, and needs - we put our heads down and went to work to build not only the current branding but previous iterations of the logo.

This involved quite a bit of research of previous seasons team designs and their evolution over the years.

At the end we were able to not only make multiple logos that are used in the show but additionally design all the merchandise used to create a believeable team.
