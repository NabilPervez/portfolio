TITLE: Immortal: Gates Of Pyre - Logo + Faction Icons
TYPE: portfolio
====================

Building The Gates
While the Sunspear Games team had done a ton of great work on the game itself, they had not spent a ton of time on branding Immortal: Gates of Pyre.

At this point, the world and the lore of the game was pretty developed so we had pools of information to draw on.

This also needed to create a unified look and feel that also branched into aspects of the world.

I lead the project connecting the Sunspear lore, leadership, and design teams. It was important to develop something organic, but also felt connected.
