CREATIVE FOR THE NEW WORLD
With WEB3 demand rising and AOE continuing to get requested help - we decided it made sense to spin up a brand that fit the look and feel of that market.

I used this as an opportunity to flex my digital creative muscles to lead the project's branding, look and feel, web design, and eventually the web development.

The development was a really fun opportunity to incorporate responsive 3D objects into design to create a living site.
