Community Building In A Pandemic
The Dallas IGDA runs a yearly party to bring the community together for a night of fun and celebrating our culture.

However with the COVID19 pandemic running rampant, in person gatherings were limited.

We decided to shift to an online formatI decided to take the initiative to work with a design team to put together a look and feel for the event, generate social graphics, and spearhead the marketing campaign.

Additionally, worked with the team to develop unique online events to make the night fun for attendees.
