Aiming For A Bullseye
Our friends at Redbull came to us with a unique problem. They had a new wheel in experience for live events. A quick and easy way to make a gaming station for people to come have a Redbull and take a load off while enjoying some games with friends.

The problem was the product looked like a massive Redbull can and they prefer to feel more subtle.

Our team went to work on putting together moodboards to eventually designing multiple looks for the Redbull team to use for any type of event.
