The Scope
The legendary OpTic Gaming brand needed a revitalization. Despite previous social media improvements, the visual identity felt dated and disconnected from the team's core values. I collaborated with the marketing team to re-establish the brand's motto and launch a comprehensive event and merchandise strategy.

The Challenge
OpTic had a massive but stagnant fanbase that wasn't being properly engaged. The visual brand lacked the "alpha" energy of the community. We needed to reconnect the team with its roots while positioning it for the future, ensuring the brand stood for something tangible.

The Solution
We established the motto: "Power. Precision. Prestige." This trifecta connected the team's dominance (Power), their sniper-montage origins (Precision), and their championship legacy (Prestige). I also spearheaded the creation of experiential events—from "special ops" scavenger hunts to "play with the pros" sessions—to bring the digital brand into the real world.

The Outcome
The results were overwhelming. OpTic transformed from a stagnant brand into one of the most talked-about teams of the year. Fans lined up at 6 AM in the cold for our events, proving the strength of the new engagement strategy. Our work was recognized with a nomination for 'Esports Team of the Year'.
