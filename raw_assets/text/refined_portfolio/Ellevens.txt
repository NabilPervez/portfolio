The Scope
Soccer superstar Gareth Bale wanted to bridge the gap between traditional sports fans and esports by launching his own team, "Ellevens." His agency hired AOE Creative to build this esports brand from scratch. We handled brand development, voice and tone, visual identity, and project management.

The Challenge
Traditional sports fans and the esports community don't always mix well. The challenge was to create a brand that appealed to both worlds—leveraging Bale's massive following while establishing authentic credibility within the esports space.

The Solution
We built the brand around the core pillars of excellence, community, and creativity. For the visual identity, we chose a motif of painting and brush strokes. This concept was simple yet "pure, honest, and personal," reflecting a touch of artistry that set it apart from the typically aggressive esports aesthetics.

The Outcome
The launch was a success, promoted directly by Gareth Bale to his millions of fans. The brand successfully carved out its niche, proving that a star-athlete-led team could have a distinct, authentic identity in the competitive gaming world.
