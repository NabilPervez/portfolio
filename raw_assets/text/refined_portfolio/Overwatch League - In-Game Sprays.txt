The Scope
Blizzard Entertainment approached us with a unique opportunity: to be the first agency of record to work directly with the studio on in-game assets for Overwatch. My role involved project management and design consulting, coordinating between the Overwatch teams and our creative talent.

The Challenge
We needed to create unique, team-specific sprays that fans would be proud to use. The challenge was to capture the identity and spirit of every Overwatch League team in a way that resonated with their specific fanbases while fitting seamlessly into the game's existing aesthetic.

The Solution
We partnered with illustrator Evan Eckhart and facilitated brainstorming sessions with every Overwatch team. We revised and refined concepts to ensure authenticity. The sprays were designed with "trash talk" in mind, allowing players to communicate competitive banter through visuals alone.

The Outcome
The project was a hit. The sprays were successfully launched and became coveted items, claimed by fans at in-person events throughout the year. We successfully set the precedent for agency collaboration on in-game assets, delivering a product that enhanced the player experience.
