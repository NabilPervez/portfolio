The Scope
Metaview approached us with a compelling premise: a "premium digital candy" app for curated gaming clips. They needed a brand identity to match their vision. I led the project, providing brand voice building and project management support.

The Challenge
The app needed to stand out in a crowded market of clip aggregators. The challenge was to build a brand that felt premium and curated, distinguishing itself from the "noise" of endless, low-quality content feeds.

The Solution
We quickly aligned with their vision and went to work. I led the development of the brand pyramid and defined the voice and tone. We positioned Metaview as "All Action. No Filler," focusing on high-quality, curated experiences.

The Outcome
The launch was successful, garnering immediate support from the fighting game community and expanding rapidly from there. The strong, clear brand identity helped Metaview quickly find its footing and resonate with users looking for a quality-first content experience.
