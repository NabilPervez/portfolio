The Scope
Paramount and Funny Or Die teamed up for "Players," a mockumentary about a League of Legends team. They needed a believable brand for the fictional team, "Fugitive." I led the rapid-turnaround branding project, covering research, ideation, logo design, and merchandise.

The Challenge
We had limited time to create a brand history that felt earned. The show's premise relied on authenticity—"Fugitive" needed to look like a real team that had evolved over years of competition. We couldn't just design one logo; we had to design a history.

The Solution
We dove deep into the visual history of League of Legends esports. We designed not just the current branding, but also "previous iterations" of the logo to be used as props and backstory elements. We extended this to a full merchandise line, ensuring every jersey and hoodie on screen looked authentic.

The Outcome
We successfully created a believable visual universe for the show. The branding stood up to scrutiny from hardcore fans and seamlessly integrated into the mockumentary format, grounding the comedy in visual reality.
