The Scope
Top streamer SypherPK wanted to launch a premium clothing brand, "Metal Umbrella," to elevate community expectations and build a sustainable revenue stream beyond streaming. We were involved from the ground floor, handling everything from conceptualization and namestorming to logo development, clothing design, and the final go-to-market strategy.

The Challenge
Merchandise in the creator space often suffers from a reputation of low quality. SypherPK wanted to break this mold by creating a high-quality fashion brand that stood on its own merits. The challenge was to build a brand that leveraged his influence but had the legs to eventually thrive independently.

The Solution
We built the brand from scratch. This started with foundational work like naming and mood boards, moving into logo development and defining the brand's voice and tone. We then executed a full-scale launch strategy, including influencer marketing, package design, and the clothing design itself. I managed the project across all verticals, ensuring a cohesive vision for the launch.

The Outcome
Metal Umbrella was an instant hit. During launch week, the brand dominated Twitch and saw exceptional conversion rates. The community and influencers alike rallied around the high-quality products, validating the strategy and successfully launching SypherPK's vision into a reality.
