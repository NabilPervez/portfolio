The Scope
Geekletes, an esports lifestyle brand and venue, needed help defining their brand voice and engaging with the community. I stepped in to lead project management, social media strategy, and event marketing.

The Challenge
The esports venue space is competitive. Geekletes needed to stand out not just as a place to play games, but as a cultural hub. The challenge was to build a community-driven brand that felt authentic to the "geek athlete" identity.

The Solution
We developed a content strategy that highlighted the lifestyle aspect of gaming. By curating social media content and organizing community events, we fostered a sense of belonging. I managed the rollout of marketing campaigns that bridged the gap between online engagement and in-person attendance.

The Outcome
We successfully built a more engaged local community, driving foot traffic to the venue and establishing Geekletes as a recognized name in the local esports scene.
