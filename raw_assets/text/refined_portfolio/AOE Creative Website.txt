The Scope
AOE Creative needed a fresh digital presence. As the lead for design, development, and implementation, I was tasked with creating a new website that reflected our "Dare To Disrupt" ethos. The scope included copywriting, CMS updating, project management, and video producing.

The Challenge
We spent so much time making our clients look good that we hadn't invested the same into our own brand. The new website needed to be lightweight yet visually impactful, showcasing our portfolio while keeping conversion points (contact buttons) readily accessible. It also required a significant upgrade to our functionality and CMS.

The Solution
I led the project with a focus on a "new year, new look" mindset. We pushed the envelope by exploring a new technical stack to improve efficiency over the predecessor. The design balanced aesthetic appeal with performance, ensuring a smooth user experience that highlighted our work without overshadowing the path to contact us.

The Outcome
The successful launch of the new AOE Creative website immediately paid dividends. The platform not only refreshed our brand image but directly contributed to business growth, capturing the attention of multiple new clients and validating our position as a forward-thinking creative agency.
