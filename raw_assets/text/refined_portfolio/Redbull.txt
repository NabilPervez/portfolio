The Scope
Red Bull needed a design solution for their new "wheel-in" gaming stations—portable setups for live events. I led the project management and design consulting to create a look that balanced visibility with Red Bull's premium, subtle aesthetic.

The Challenge
The initial prototype looked like a "massive Red Bull can," which was too loud and aggressive for the brand's desired vibe. They wanted something that felt premium and invited people to "take a load off" without screaming branding in their face.

The Solution
We developed multiple mood boards and design concepts, focusing on a sleeker, more versatile look. The final designs allowed the gaming stations to fit naturally into various event types while still maintaining unmistakable brand recognition.

The Outcome
We delivered a suite of approved designs that gave Red Bull the flexibility they needed. The stations successfully serve as inviting hubs for gamers at events, achieving the goal of facilitating social connection over a cold drink.
