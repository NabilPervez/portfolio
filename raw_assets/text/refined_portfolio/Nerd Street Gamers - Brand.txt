The Scope
Nerd Street Gamers (NSG) had evolved from a Philadelphia passion project into a major industry player working with top-tier partners. They needed a full rebrand to reflect this maturity. My role included project management, brand voice/tone consulting, and developing a "look and feel" that balanced professionalism with their gaming roots.

The Challenge
NSG needed to look professional enough for corporate partners/investors but stay authentic enough for gamers. They also needed a visual identity that was "adaptable"—able to sit comfortably alongside the branding of their diverse partners and child companies.

The Solution
We established core values and a brand voice that was "professional yet conversational." We developed a visual identity centered on adaptability, creating a color and graphic system that could integrate key elements from partners without losing its own identity. I also provided a comprehensive launch strategy to guide the transition.

The Outcome
The rebrand was a triumph. It received public appreciation and was even utilized in advertisements on NBC. NSG transitioned smoothly to the new look, which has scaled with them as they continue to push boundaries in the esports space.
