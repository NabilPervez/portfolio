The Scope
With the universe of "Immortal: Gates Of Pyre" expanding, Sunspear Games needed a way to consolidate their deep lore into an accessible format. I led the production of a Lore Book and accompanying video series, managing copywriters, video editors, and designers.

The Challenge
The game's lore was dense and complex. We needed to package it in a way that was digestible for everyone—from the average gamer to high-level investors who struggled to visualize the full scope of the IP.

The Solution
I acted as the bridge between the Immortal creative team and our agency, setting clear expectations and timelines. We produced a beautifully designed Lore Book that visually and narratively explained the universe. To supplement this, we created a video series that brought these stories to life, offering a dynamic way to understand the world.

The Outcome
The project was a dual success. The digital Lore Book became a key asset that helped secure significant business and investment for Sunspear. It was also so popular with fans that it became a purchasable physical item in the Kickstarter. The videos provided the clarity needed for both players and partners to fully grasp the potential of the Immortal universe.
