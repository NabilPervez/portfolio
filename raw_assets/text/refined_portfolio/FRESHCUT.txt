The Scope
Our partners at Metaview needed a rebrand to better align with the Web3 space. They approached us to help evolve their company into "FreshCut." The scope included naming, branding, community building, and social media strategy.

The Challenge
Metaview had evolved, and their old brand no longer reflected their new offerings or the decentralized future they were building. We needed to find a name and identity that signaled this shift clearly to the market without alienating their existing user base.

The Solution
We facilitated a full rebranding process, starting with a "namestorming" phase that led to "FreshCut." We then developed a visual identity and strategy that felt native to the Web3 ecosystem—vibrant, community-focused, and forward-looking.

The Outcome
The rebrand successfully positioned FreshCut as a leader in the Web3 gaming content space. The new identity resonated with the target audience, helping them build a strong community and clearly communicate their value proposition in a crowded market.
