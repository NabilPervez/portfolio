The Scope
The Dallas chapter of the IGDA (International Game Developers Association) needed to pivot their annual celebration during the COVID-19 pandemic. I took the initiative to lead the marketing campaign, including event marketing, social media strategy, and design consulting.

The Challenge
The pandemic made in-person gatherings impossible, threatening the community's annual tradition. The challenge was to translate the energy and connection of a physical party into an online format without losing the personal touch.

The Solution
We fully pivoted to a digital experience. I worked with a design team to create a cohesive "look and feel" for the event and spearheaded a marketing campaign to drive attendance. We developed unique online activities to ensure the night was interactive and fun, rather than just another Zoom call.

The Outcome
The event was a resounding success, bringing in over 100 engaged users—many of whom were new to Discord gatherings. The success of this pivot actually shifted the culture, developing a sustainable online following that continued to thrive in monthly meetups long after the event concluded.
