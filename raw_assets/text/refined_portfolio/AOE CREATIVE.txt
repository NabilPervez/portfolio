The Scope
As a co-founder of AOE Creative in 2018, I wore many hats to build the agency from the ground up. My primary roles included Head Project Manager, CTO, and Marketer. Our mission was to forge strong relationships between clients and our experts to connect with modern, digital audiences in the gaming and nerd culture space.

The Challenge
Building a creative agency requires more than just design skills; it demands seamless integration with client teams, rapid communication, and consistent improvement. We needed to establish ourselves as a premier agency capable of handling high-profile clients like Red Bull, Blizzard Activision, Riot Games, Paramount, and LEGO Games, while maintaining the intensity and passion for our craft.

The Solution
We adopted an approach of purpose and hunger, integrating deeply with client practices to ensure efficient results. My leadership covered a vast scope, including branding, influencer marketing, community building, event marketing, and partnership development. I also provided design and website consulting, ensuring our technical infrastructure matched our creative output.

The Outcome
AOE Creative successfully established itself as a key player in the industry, working with major global brands. Our dedication to quality and innovation was recognized with "Best Creative Agency Finalist" nominations for four consecutive years (2019-2022). We successfully delivered comprehensive solutions across branding, social media, and merchandise for top-tier game developers and publishers.
