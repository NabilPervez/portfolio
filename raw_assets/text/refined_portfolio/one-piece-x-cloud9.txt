THE CHALLENGE
Creating an apparel line that reflects the unique identities and values of both Toei Animation's One Piece anime and Cloud9, while also designing a cohesive and attractive visual style.
Our work had to navigate through trends in apparel design, targeted customer preferences, and the heavy production constraints of the apparel industry.
The goal was to create a collection of clothing items that could showcase a Grand Line where both brands intersect in values, visual identity, and voice to generate excitement and engagement among their respective audiences.
