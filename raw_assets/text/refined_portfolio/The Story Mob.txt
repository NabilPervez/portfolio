The Scope
The Story Mob, a PR agency specializing in gaming and esports, approached us for a comprehensive rebrand and website overhaul. The scope involved project management, branding, developing a new "look and feel," and full web design.

The Challenge
With a "new year, new look" goal, The Story Mob wanted to completely transform their digital presence. They needed a website that was not just visually updated but also significantly more efficient and performant than their previous iteration.

The Solution
Calculated and precise, we guided them through a process that started with establishing a brand look via social media mockups before moving to full-scale web design. I pushed the development team to adopt a modern tech stack to ensure the new site was fast and efficient. We worked closely ("PR Partner") to piece together a cohesive picture of their agency.

The Outcome
The project resulted in a beautifully redesigned website that was visually stunning and easy to read. Both the client and their users expressed high satisfaction with the experience. The technical upgrades ensured the site was not just a pretty face but a high-performing asset for their business.
