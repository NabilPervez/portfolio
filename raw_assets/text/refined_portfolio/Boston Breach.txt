The Scope
Oxygen Esports, backed by the Kraft Group, acquired the Boston slot for the Call of Duty League (CDL) and inherited a team with little time to prepare. Referred by Activision Blizzard, they hired us to build the brand from scratch. My role span branding, marketing strategy, merchandise, and project management.

The Challenge
Oxygen Esports were the "new kids on the block"—short on time, money, and standing compared to established franchises. We needed to build a brand that the notoriously passionate Boston sports fans would embrace, while turning their underdog status into a narrative strength.

The Solution
We leaned into the motifs of the American Revolution and freedom, central to Boston's identity. We built the "Boston Breach" brand around the concept of a digital revolution—empowering the people to shake up the league. The visual identity and voice were crafted to feel rebellious yet rooted in the city's history.

The Outcome
The engagement was insane. Bostonians and CDL fans flocked to the brand, drawn by its unique look and voice. The Discord community became immediately active, and the team achieved higher Twitter engagement than any other team in the league, proving that a strong brand narrative can level the playing field.
