Only The Freshest
Our friends at Metaview approached us for a rebrand to help them better look the part in the WEB3 space.

Keeping in mind our previous work on the Metaview brand, it was an interesting opportunity to find how the company had evolved and how their offerings are different now.

From there we began a full rebrand including a renaming process.
