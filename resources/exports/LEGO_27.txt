Building Things Brick By Brick
When we met with LEGO they had a unique problem. They had a ton of great work being done in the video game space with their IP, but no centralized brand to house all the interactions around it. They had recently formed a team to specifically address this but realized they also did not have a brand to house it.

Our team helped in a variety of ways from branding and package design to understanding the positioning LEGO GAMES had to take in the market and how developers and publishes ultimately marketed for them.
