====================

Into The Breach
After gaining backing from the Kraft group and obtaining the CDL Boston slot, Oxygen Esports had very little time and a lot of building to do for the team they inherited.

Activision Blizzard refereed them to our team for building a brand after we had created the award winning OWL team, the Houston Outlaws.Our goal was to build a team that Bostonians will become a fan of, but also play into the narrative that Oxygen were facing.

They were the new kids on the block lacking money, standing, and importantly time.

Thinking through the motifs of American revolution and freedom, we built Breach with the idea of empowering the people. In a digital revolution, the Breach and the Collective are the means to shake things up in the CDL with old talent and money.
