Evolving With The Times
The fighting game industry is relatively small and I've been lucky enough to make a lot of friends thanks to commentary.

I was esctatic to hear Rick / Hadou taking on the role of GM for Evolution after years of crushing it with Combobreaker.

After congratulations were exchanged, Rick asked for a call and described the help he needed with web design, development, and graphic design.Eager to help a friend and working with the largest fighting game (a bucket list item personally) - we dove into the work.

There were lots of initial discussions on balancing capabilities, constrictions, budget, and goals.

From there I lead the design and development team to put together an update for the website that fans will be able to enjoy both as a competitor and a viewer.
