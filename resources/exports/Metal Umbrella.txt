You're Not Failing, You're Learning
One of the top streamers in the world, SypherPK, became interested in spinning up a clothing business for a couple of reasons.

He wanted to make clothing that was at a higher level of quality than what the community had come to expect.

Additionally, he wanted to build something that could generate revenue when he eventually stopped streaming someday.Our team was a part of this from the ground floor and build it from there.
