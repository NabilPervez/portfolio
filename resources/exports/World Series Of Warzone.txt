The Biggest Names In Warzone
In the period between CDL majors, Activision approached us to help produce trailers and market their World Series Of Warzone event that featured the largest creators in the world duking it out for prizes.

Our goal was to design a look and feel that worked for social media graphics but also for video content. We put together a full package of motion graphics, hand picked clips to highlight the creators, and music to create the best possible product that COD fans could get excited about.
