====================

Dare To Disrupt
AOE Creative was in need of a new look for their website. We spent so much time working on making other clients look good, we had not taken that same time for ourselves.

When building this site it was important to build a lightweight website where it showcases the clientwork of AOE.

While readily leaving the contact button available for users to click throughMy role was to lead this project on both the design, development, and implementation.

Additionally, this involved an in-depth look into functionality and updating the CMS.
