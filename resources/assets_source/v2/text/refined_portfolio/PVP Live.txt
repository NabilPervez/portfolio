The Scope
PVP Live aimed to be the go-to news source for the gaming and esports community. My role was to run the digital and influencer marketing divisions, responsible for getting our content in front of a massive, growing audience through strategic partnerships and data-driven decisions.

The Challenge
The challenge was distribution. Producing great content wasn't enough; we needed to cut through the noise. We had to find sustainable, effective ways to drive traffic from social platforms to our site and video content.

The Solution
I pioneered an influencer marketing strategy focused on specific engagement matches—finding the right personalities for specific topics rather than just chasing follower counts. I also managed social media channels and utilized data reporting to refine our approach constantly.

The Outcome
We grew PVP Live into one of the largest esports news organizations. My strategies helped gain 100,000 new Twitter followers with high engagement turnover. We reached 3 million active users per month, with 30% of that traffic driven directly by the influencer and Facebook group strategies I implemented.
