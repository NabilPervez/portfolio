The Scope
The LEGO Group needed guidance on navigating the complex intersection of their traditional brand and the gaming ecosystem. Our team provided comprehensive consulting that ranged from branding and package design to high-level market positioning for LEGO GAMES. My role covered project management, community building, and strategy across social media and newsletters.

The Challenge
LEGO is a household name, but the gaming market requires a specific nuanced approach. The challenge was to position LEGO GAMES in a way that resonated with both developers and publishers while maintaining the core values of the LEGO brand. We needed to bridge the gap between physical play and digital expectations.

The Solution
We worked closely with their team to define how developers and publishers should market their titles under the LEGO banner. This involved detailed work on branding, package design, and communication strategies. I helped implement newsletters and social media strategies that effectively communicated this new direction to the target audience.

The Outcome
Our strategic guidance helped clarify LEGO GAMES' position in the market. By establishing clear standards for branding and marketing, we empowered them to work more effectively with their partners, ensuring that every digital product felt authentically LEGO.
