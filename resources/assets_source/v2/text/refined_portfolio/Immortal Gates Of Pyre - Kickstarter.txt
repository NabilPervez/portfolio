The Scope
Sunspear Games needed to launch "Immortal: Gates Of Pyre" with a bang. I managed the entire Kickstarter campaign branding and strategy, coordinating marketing, design, video production, and partnerships. The scope spanned from social media strategy and merchandise to influencer marketing and community management.

The Challenge
The goals were ambitious: raise development funds, build an engaged community, and generate significant press. We needed to orchestrate a multi-month campaign that included building a Discord community from scratch, securing an influencer roster, and strictly adhering to Kickstarter's guidelines to maximize visibility.

The Solution
We executed a comprehensive strategy starting with user acquisition and Discord engagement. We built a brand new visual identity for the campaign, produced high-quality trailers and social videos, and structured compelling reward tiers. I managed all cross-functional teams to ensure a unified push towards the launch.

The Outcome
The results were phenomenal. The campaign didn't just meet its funding goal—it raised 500% (5X) of the target. We reached the funding goal within hours of launch. Additionally, Kickstarter featured the campaign as a "Project We Love," validating the quality and excitement we generated around the game.
