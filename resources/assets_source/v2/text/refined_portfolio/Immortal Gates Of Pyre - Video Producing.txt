The Scope
As marketing for "Immortal: Gates Of Pyre" ramped up, Sunspear Games needed to populate their YouTube channel and generate social content efficiently. I led the video production project, managing strategy, design consulting, and cross-team coordination.

The Challenge
The client needed to "kill two birds with one stone": build long-form YouTube content while simultaneously generating a steady stream of short-form clips for social media, all without ballooning production time or costs.

The Solution
I devised a "segment-based" content strategy. We produced long-form videos structured as multiple smaller segments. This allowed us to publish substantial YouTube episodes while slicing them into bite-sized "ammo" for the social media team. I coordinated between graphic design, motion, marketing, and editing teams to ensure a high-quality pipeline.

The Outcome
This efficienct pipeline successfully populated their channels with high-quality content. The strategy maximized the value of every minute of production, ensuring that the marketing team always had fresh assets to engage the community across all platforms.
