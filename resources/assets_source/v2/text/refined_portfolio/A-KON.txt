The Scope
A-KON, one of the longest-running anime conventions, approached us with a need for a modernized digital presence. My role focused on project management, design consulting, and updating their website to better serve their massive attendee base.

The Challenge
Handling a legacy brand like A-KON requires respecting its history while updating its functionality for modern users. The challenge was to create a digital experience that could handle high traffic and complex information architecture (schedules, guests, maps) without feeling cluttered or outdated.

The Solution
We streamlined the user experience, focusing on mobile-responsiveness and ease of access to critical information. I managed the design and development teams to ensure the new site reflected the vibrant energy of the convention while remaining highly functional for attendees on the go.

The Outcome
The refreshed website provided a seamless experience for thousands of attendees, reducing friction in finding event details and enhancing the overall convention experience.
