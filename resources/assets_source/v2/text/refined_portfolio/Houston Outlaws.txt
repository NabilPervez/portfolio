The Scope
For the inaugural season of the Overwatch League, I was tasked with local marketing for the Houston Outlaws. My mission was to build a community across the massive region of South Texas (Houston, Austin, San Antonio). The scope included event marketing, merchandise strategy, and partnership development.

The Challenge
We needed to turn a digital franchise into a physical phenomenon. The challenge was to connect disparate fans across hundreds of miles and cultivate a shared "Outlaws" identity that would drive them to attend in-person events.

The Solution
We launched the award-winning "#BandTogether" campaign. This innovative strategy included organizing the world's first esports player tour, pop-up shops, and block parties. We also introduced region-specific, collectible merchandise to gamify attendance and foster brand loyalty.

The Outcome
The results were historic. The campaign won the Tempest Award for "Best Social Experience" and helped the Outlaws become the most tweeted-about team in the league during Season 1. We successfully built a passionate, traveling fan base that set the standard for local esports marketing.
