The Scope
With the rise of Web3, AOE Creative saw a demand for specialized services in this emerging market. We decided to spin up "Blast Radius," a dedicated agency brand. I led the project's branding, look and feel, and web design, taking a hands-on creative role.

The Challenge
The Web3 space has a distinct aesthetic and culture. We needed a brand that felt native to that environment while maintaining the professional standards of our parent agency. The website needed to be more than just informational; it had to be a "living" digital experience that demonstrated our capabilities.

The Solution
I used this as an opportunity to flex my digital creative muscles. The development focused on incorporating responsive 3D objects to create a dynamic, immersive website. We built a brand identity that was bold ("Creative for the New World") and perfectly tailored to the Web3 audience.

The Outcome
The launch of Blast Radius successfully positioned us to capture the growing demand in the Web3 sector. The website itself stands as a portfolio piece, demonstrating our ability to merge cutting-edge design with technical innovation. (You can see the work at blastradius.agency).
