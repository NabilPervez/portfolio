The Scope
For the inaugural season of the Overwatch League, I was tasked with local marketing for the Houston Outlaws. My mission was to build a community across Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. This involved event marketing, merchandise, social strategy, and partnership development.

The Challenge
We needed to turn a brand new digital team into a tangible local phenomenon. The goal was to connect disparate Overwatch fans across a massive geographic region (South Texas) and get them to physically show up and engage with the team.

The Solution
We launched the award-winning "#BandTogether" campaign. This included organizing watch parties, block parties, pop-up shops, and the world's first esports player tour. We created region-specific, collectible merchandise to incentivize fans to travel to events and "complete the set."

The Outcome
The campaign was a massive success, achieving multiple "firsts" in the industry (first player tour, first pop-up shop). We won the Tempest Award for "Best Social Experience" and were finalists for "Esports Team of the Year." Most importantly, the Houston Outlaws became the most tweeted-about team in the league during Season 1, proving that local engagement drives global conversation.
