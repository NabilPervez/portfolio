The Scope
Activision recruited us to produce trailers and social marketing assets for the "World Series of Warzone," a major tournament featuring the world's biggest creators. My role included video producing, social media strategy, and design consulting.

The Challenge
Warzone is fast-paced and chaotic. We needed a visual identity for the marketing that matched this energy but was polished enough for a premier global event. The assets needed to work equally well as standalone social graphics and within dynamic video content.

The Solution
We designed a cohesive "look and feel" package including motion graphics, custom overlays, and music selection. We hand-picked clips to highlight the star power of the participating creators, ensuring the content felt personal and high-stakes.

The Outcome
We delivered a premium broadcast package and marketing suite that hyped the community. The assets successfully bridged the gap between raw gameplay and professional esports production, setting the stage for one of Warzone's biggest competitive events.
