The Scope
The Fan Controlled Football League (FCFL) needed a brand update and a website designed to captivate a Gen Z and Gen Y audience. Our involvement spanned project management, marketing strategy, and activation concept ideation.

The Challenge
The FCFL is unique—literally "Power To The Fans." They needed a digital presence that reflected this high-energy, interactive concept. The goal was to attract a younger demographic and establish a look that felt modern and engaging, distinct from traditional sports leagues.

The Solution
We started by establishing a visual direction through social media mockups to test engagement. Once refined, we expanded this aesthetic into a full website design and wireframe. The design focused on vibrant, dynamic elements that resonated with the target audience's preferences for interactivity and bold visuals.

The Outcome
We delivered a comprehensive brand look and a website that served as the digital hub for the league. The design successfully appealed to the Gen Z/Y demographic, helping the FCFL establish its identity as a forward-thinking, fan-first league.
