The Scope
Tourney Locator approached us to produce a hype trailer for "Low Tide City," a Super Smash Bros. tournament held at a massive indoor waterpark. I led the video production and concepting, along with providing light social media strategy for the launch.

The Challenge
The event had a unique selling point—a major tournament inside a waterpark. The trailer needed to capture this specific "vacation meets competition" vibe immediately to drive registration.

The Solution
I directed a motion graphics-heavy trailer that leaned into the aquatic theme ("Adding a Splash of Color"). We combined high-energy gameplay footage with the relaxed, fun atmosphere of the venue to create a compelling narrative for prospective attendees.

The Outcome
The trailer was a smash hit. Within hours of the announcement and trailer launch, the tournament reached its maximum capacity. The marketing successfully conveyed the unique experience, driving immediate and overwhelming demand.
