The Scope
Despite significant development on the game itself, "Immortal: Gates Of Pyre" lacked a unified brand identity. I led the branding project, connecting Sunspear's lore and leadership teams with our art directors to create the game's logo, planet icons, faction icons, and resource icons.

The Challenge
The game had a deep, developed lore that needed to be visually represented. We needed to create a cohesive "look and feel" that felt organic to the world they had built, while ensuring all icons and logos were distinct and recognizable.

The Solution
We mined the existing lore for visual queues and worked iteratively to develop a design language. I bridged the gap between the narrative team and our designers to ensure every asset, from the main logo to the smallest resource icon, felt connected to the game's universe.

The Outcome
The Sunspear Games team was blown away by the final product. The designs provided the visual anchor the game needed. They now proudly use these assets across all media, from the game UI to marketing materials, successfully unifying the game's visual identity.
