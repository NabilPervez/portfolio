The Scope
Note: The source text for this file appears to be a duplicate of the Houston Outlaws content. Assuming based on the title "Stay Plugged In" (a recruiting platform for collegiate esports) that the content is missing, I will draft a placeholder based on typical agency work in this sector if you wish, or I can leave it as a corrected version of the Outlaws text if that was the intent. 

*Correction:* Since I cannot invent details, I will flag this as a content error in the source files. However, if this was meant to be the Outlaws file (again), I have already processed that. 

(If "Stay Plugged In" is a distinct client, I would write):
The Scope
Stay Plugged In connects high school esports athletes with collegiate scholarships. We were tasked with refining their brand and marketing strategy to better reach both students and recruiters.

The Challenge
The collegiate esports space is fragmented. We needed to position Stay Plugged In as the premier bridge between talent and opportunity, making the complex recruitment process feel accessible and exciting.

The Solution
We focused on a student-first messaging strategy. We streamlined their visual identity to be energetic and aspirational. (Note: Specific details were unavailable in source text, so this is a generalized reconstruction).
