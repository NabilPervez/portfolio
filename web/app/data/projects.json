My mission was to build a community across Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. This involved event marketing, merchandise, social strategy, and partnership development.</li></ul>",
      "challenge": "We needed to turn a brand new digital team into a tangible local phenomenon. The goal was to connect disparate Overwatch fans across a massive geographic region (South Texas) and get them to physically show up and engage with the team.",
      "solution": "We launched the award-winning \"#BandTogether\" campaign. This included organizing watch parties, block parties, pop-up shops, and the world's first esports player tour. We created region-specific, collectible merchandise to incentivize fans to travel to events and \"complete the set.\"",
      "outcome": "The campaign was a massive success, achieving multiple \"firsts\" in the industry (first player tour, first pop-up shop). We won the Tempest Award for \"Best Social Experience\" and were finalists for \"Esports Team of the Year.\" Most importantly, the Houston Outlaws became the most tweeted-about team in the league during Season 1, proving that local engagement drives global conversation."

Working with limited visual assets, due to the early development stage of the game, AOE stepped into the gap and filled this void with creative asset generation that worked seamlessly with Treehouses existing brand and visual assets.\nWEB DESIGN\nThe bulk of the work we did for Treehouse Games went into the design and development of the hype-site. We worked closely with their team to provide them a site which beautifully introduced Voyagers of Nera to newcomers.\nMOBILE DESIGN\nAlthough we aimed for visual fidelity and a unique design, we made sure plan ahead and provide a site that would function seamlessly while in a condensed mobile format.\nCONTACT US"
